## Small utilities

These are simply some small programs that I wrote to perform basic actions on my system.

> `fracsimp.c`: C program to simplify fractions (very similar to below program).

> `fraction_simplifier.rs`: Rust program to simplify fractions (very similar to above program).

> `mdc.c`: C program to calculate the greatest common divisor from two integers (very similar to below program).

> `mdc.rs`: Rust program to calculate the greatest common divisor from two integers (very similar to above program).

> `ram_speed.c`: C program to calculate a RAM's Clock Speed (very similar to below program).

> `ram_speed.rs`: Rust program to calculate a RAM's Clock Speed (very similar to above program).

> `randomcase.c`: C program to randomize characters' case in a text file, or through stdin (very similar to below program).

> `randomcase.rs`: Rust program to randomize characters' case through stdin (very similar to above program).

> `linux-ver.sh`: Bash script to notify you when a new Linux release gets uploaded to Github.

> `update-citra-nightly.sh`: Bash script to download the newest Citra Nightly linux release on Github.

> `DEPRECATED: kegel_routine.sh`: Bash script with multiple cronometers for a Kegel exercises routine.

> `kegel_routine.rs`: Rust version of above program, with higher efficiency and just better overall.
